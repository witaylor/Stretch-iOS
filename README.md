This is the repo containing the Xcode project for the iOS app produced as part of my dissertation. 

Stretch is an app designed to reduce the discomfort users experience when sitting. The core functionality is to provide the user with a daily routine of stretches that lasts 10-15 minutes. 

## ðŸš¦ Before you start

If you want to build the app locally, you'll need a Mac running macOS Catalina 10.15.4 or later, with Xcode 12 installed. If you don't already have Xcode, you can download [here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
You can run the app on your Mac using Simulator, but if you want to use the app on a physical device, you'll need an iPhone running iOS 14 or newer. 

## ðŸš€ How to use

The easiest way to run this app is by installing it directly from TestFlight. To do this, [install TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) on your iPhone and then simply tap the following link:

This link is guaranteed to be active until, at least, May 30, 2021. Alternatively, you can clone this repo and build it by opening `Stretch-iOS.xcodeproj`.

The current version of the app is the same one used by participants during the evaluation conducted as part of the dissertation project.
